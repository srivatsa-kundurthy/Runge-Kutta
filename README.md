# RUNGE KUTTA Methods Presentation

Code and Notes from a Talk on Runge-Kutta Methods for Approximating Differential Equations.


* Why do we approximate?
* Euler's Method (Developed from Linearization)
* Taylor Approximations (And Error Bounds) - (Euler is Taylor)
* Other Runge Kutta Methods - RK2, RK4
* Demo of Euler's Method for Physical Modeling - Double Pendulum, Lotka-Volterra

`DEMOS` contains both Demos.  
`RESOURCES` contains a list of helpful sources to look at for further learning.  
`NOTES` contains raw research notes.
